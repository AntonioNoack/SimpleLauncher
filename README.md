Small, compact version of RedlabsUpdateUtility.dll

I found this file/updating utility by Block Battles from Davee, Alice and 8hider, and imho, it was wayy to large at 150MB. To challenge myself, and to learn a little about the Windows API, I wrote my own tool with the same functionality (from the player perspective, idk about any analytics in RedlabsUpdateUtility), and extended it with a customizable background image, and icon.

My version ended up at a size of 124kB, which is 1200x smaller than the original ðŸ˜².
