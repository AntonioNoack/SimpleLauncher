Small, compact version of RedlabsUpdateUtility.dll

I found this file/updating utility by Block Battles from Davee, Alice and 8hider, and imho, it was wayy to large at 150MB. To challenge myself, and to learn a little about the Windows API, I wrote my own tool with the same functionality (from the player perspective, idk about any analytic in RedlabsUpdateUtility), and extended it my an image from the game, and custom icon.

My version ended up at a size of 122kB, which is 1200x smaller than the original ðŸ˜².
